## 💡 Recommendation:

**The Google Fit optimization is COMPLETE and WORKING!** 

The unused methods are mostly old legacy code that doesn't affect performance. You can:

1. **Run the app now** - It works great with optimizations
2. **Clean up later** - Remove unused code when convenient
3. **Leave it** - Unused code doesn't hurt functionality

**Your call!** The important optimizations are done. 🎉

Would you like me to:
- A) Comment out all unused methods (safe)
- B) Delete all unused methods (thorough)
- C) Leave as-is (app works fine)
